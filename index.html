                <p class="text">Maynooth Furniture is one of the first projects that I embarked on while learning UI
                    design. It was a fun and great experience; it offered a challenge, which I love. This project taught
                    me valuable lessons on the concepts of prototyping and interactivity. Basically trying to mimic the
                    feel of the final product. A persona was created for this project, and it was based on someone who
                    loved interior decor but was mindful about their pocketsâ€”someone not too old with a little family.
                    All these spoke to me in the process of creating this; the choice of colors and minimalist design
                    style for this project were all a result of trying to satisfy such a character.</p>

                <h3 class="text">Kitchenware Commerce</h3>
                <p class="text">This project was a collaboration with another web developer. Although it did not take up
                    its final form as an e-commerce website, it was a great experience for me because of the time
                    constraints that I was able to meet. The client required that the site have an "Amazon-esque" feel
                    in terms of a multi-level navbar, characterized by the presence of a search bar and categories for
                    the available products. They were also specific with the colors since they wanted something that was
                    in line with their brand. I therefore decided to go for their needs but with a little twist. I tried
                    to achieve a futuristic feel that would capture the hearts of the young and the young at heart.
                    Something that would stand out from all the competitors in that market segment.</p>

                <p class="text">"Color Admin" is an administrator dashboard that helps administrators monitor various
                    metrics and statistics at a glance. The norm at my work place is to design a rough sketch and edit
                    the "Color Admin" programatically; however, there was one customer who presented a great challenge
                    with respect to the completion time requirements of his project. There needed to be frequent
                    communication with this client to make sure he was satisfied; therefore, the solution was to
                    replicate the color admin interface on Figma to get all the technicalities right before proceeding
                    to code. I was tasked with this, and I started by creating the components that are present on the
                    "Color Admin" template itself; this aided the team in creating the various pages easily.</p>

                <p class="text">This project was another exciting one that presented a challenge. A first meeting with
                    the client established the fact that she needed something that represented feminism in a bold yet
                    elegant manner. I pondered over these pointers and decided on the colors and style to use. I went
                    with a youthful purple look that satisfied the needs of the client. She was wowed when she saw how
                    the site turned out and acknowledged the fact that the site exceeded her expectations. Mansah Media
                    is a media production company that deals in all manner of media works; therefore, it is imperative
                    that it is able to capture the attention of its prospective clients.</p>

                    churches within Ghana and beyond. While the actual project was being worked on, I was tasked with
                    creating the landing page to sell the product. What will help a product sell? In this context, the
                    website would have to be convincing enough in summary. That was the goal when I was working on this
                    website. I made sure to capture the attention of potential clients with the design and convince them
                    that they need the system with the information present on the website. I was pleased with myself
                    after completing this project, as it was undoubtedly beautiful.</p>

                    "Shea Butter Commerce" is another project that did not come to fruition because of some technical
                    difficulties on the client's end. The client needed a classy commerce site to sell shea butter,
                    which is very useful to humans. The mindset I had with this one was to capture the various colors
                    that shea butter represents. I then made these colors communicate in such a way that the target user
                    would be drawn to make purchases. I took away valuable lessons from this project, as the time
                    constraints were scanty. I can proudly say that this project was completed in a very short time with
                    highly desirable results.</p>

                    "HTML and CSS for Novices," that will guide beginners of no specific age group to find their feet in

                <p class="text">"BaseCSS" is short for basic CSS. This is a boilerplate or framework that I made with
                    the beginner in mind.
                    The idea came about when I was learning JavaScript. I wanted to create an avenue for new developers
                    to be able to learn JavaScript with style, meaning I wanted to empower developers to learn
                    JavaScript without being too rigid in terms of design, where they can style their webpages
                    with ease and without taking the focus off the concepts
                    they may be trying to grasp.
                    It focuses on the fundamentals of CSS but in an easy and efficient manner. It is light-weight,
                    concise, and precise. Anyone with an interest in web development can pick it up.
